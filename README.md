# pol-ingame-vpl

Example script from Northern Winds server 2008. Package for custom Ultima Online POL server software.

Provides game moderators tools for creating game logic within the game, allowing to create dynamic items, events and other tools. As far as I know, this was the first implementation of basic programming functions from ingame in Ultima Online.
