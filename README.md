# pol-ingame-vpl

Example script from Northern Winds server 2008. Package for custom Ultima Online <a href="http://www.polserver.com/">POL server software</a>.

Provides game moderators tools for creating game logic within the game, allowing to create dynamic items, events and other tools. As far as I know, this was the first implementation of basic programming functions from ingame in Ultima Online.
